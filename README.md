# Restaurant Reviews App 

## Project Overview: 

Project for Udacity's Front-End Nanodegree. I converted a static webpage into a mobile-ready web application and implemented accessibility features in the site HTML (mostly generated by JavaScript functions). I also added a service worker script to cache requests to all of the siteâ€™s assets to begin the process of creating a seamless offline experience for users.

### How to run the application

Download or clone this repository. 

In a terminal, check the version of Python you have: `python -V`

If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` 
(or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.) 

For Python 3.x, you can use `python3 -m http.server 8000`

If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's [website](https://www.python.org/) to download and install the software.

Note -  For Windows systems, Python 3.x is installed as `python` by default. To start a Python 3.x server, you can simply enter `python -m http.server 8000`.
   
With your server running, visit the site: `http://localhost:8000`,

## Leaflet.js and Mapbox:

This repository uses [leafletjs](https://leafletjs.com/) with [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/). 

### Note about ES6

Most of the code in this project has been written to the ES6 JavaScript specification for compatibility with modern web browsers and future-proofing JavaScript code.
